main.c contains the code for part 1. gauss.c contains the code for part 2.

To compile each, use gcc FILENAME.c -o OUTPUTEXECUTABLE -lpthread

In main.c, the bitonic fuctions must be called with arrays that have size 2^n.
In gauss.c, the global int n specifies the number of matricies, but should not go below 4.

To run, simply ./OUTPUTEXECUTABLE
